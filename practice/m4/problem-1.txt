            step1: "it" is inserted to the stack
            step2: "Was" is inserted to the stack
            step3: next is "-" so we need to pop "Was"
            step4: "the" is inserted to the stack
            step5: "best" is inserted to the stack
            step6: next is "-" so pop "best"
            step7: "of" is inserted to the stack
            step8: "times" is inserted to the stack
               * the elements present in the stack are "it" , "the" , "of", times
            step9: next is "-" so pop "times"
            step10: next is "-" so pop "of"
            step11: next is "-" so pop "the"
            step12: "it" is inserted to the stack
            step13: "was" is inserted to the stack
            step14: next is "-" so pop "was"
            step15: "the" is inserted to the stack
            step16:  next is "-" so pop "the"
            step17: next is "-" so pop "it"(the second inserted element)

            after all the elements pushing and popping .
            
            ***so, the data that is remaining in the stack is only "it".
