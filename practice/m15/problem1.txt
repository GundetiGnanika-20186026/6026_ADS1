I would like to use Symbol table implementation using binary search  because its complexity in linked list is
   Complexity for put() : O(N)
   Complexity for get() : O(N)
where as in Binary Search:
    Complexity for put() : O(log(N))
    Complexity for get() : O(log(N))
hence for larger operations like 10^6 and 10^3 binary search symbol tree is efficient.
